Greetings!

As a bioinformatics developer with a background in molecular biology and genetics, I bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to the table. I am well-versed in R, Python, and full-stack development with JavaScript, making me a versatile and adaptable teammate. 

I'm also a pro at handling complex data sets using SQL platforms like SQLite and MySQL.  And, with my training in both full-stack development and UX/UI design, I can create beautifully designed interfaces that are intuitive and user-friendly. 

I believe in bringing a sense of fun and excitement to the development process, so we can all enjoy the journey together. Let's make something incredible! 🚀
